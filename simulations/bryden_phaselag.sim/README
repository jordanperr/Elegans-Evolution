bryden_segment phase lagged oscillator
Jordan Perr-Sauer 2011
_____________________________

This code evolves many 2 neuron
segments with self connections to
oscillate with a lagged phase. 

This is one representative sample
out of many tests. I did not package
the other tests, but can dig them up
upon request.
