========== TO BUILD ==========

  Run "make all" to build all agents.

  There are GNU Make directives for every agent in ./agents/
   Run "make agent_name.agt" in the repository root.
   The executable will be in ./build/

  More information about each agent can be found in their
   respective README files.



========== EVOLVING AN AGENT ON XGRID ==========

  Build desired agent normally.
  Use the script located in ./xgrid to run agent on xgrid



========== EVOLVING AN AGENT ON CONDOR ==========

  NOT YET SUPPORTED
  


========== AGENTS ==========

- linear_distance
    LinearBody CTRNN evolver for horizontal distance.

- lagged_sinudoid
    LinearBody simulator with phase lagged sinusoid inputs to muscles.

- bryden_oscillation
    Implementation of single segment oscillator from (Bryden).

- bryden_phaselag
    Implementation of multiple, phase lagged (Bryden) oscillators.



========== LIBRARIES ==========

- LinearBody
    C Elegans body simulator with CTRNN controlled actuation and evolution.

- Beer
    Evolutionary Agents classes from Professor Randall Beer



========== PLANS ==========

   - Add RK4 or Verlet integration to LinearBody

   - Implement klinotaxis as described by (Izquierdo)
